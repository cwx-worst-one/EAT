## Introduction 
EAT is an audio SSL model with high effectiveness and efficiency during self-supervised pre-training. You can find details in the paper [EAT: Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Efficient Audio Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03497). 


## Requirements and Installation
The minimum environment requirements are `Python >= 3.8` and `PyTorch >= 1.13`. We now support **[Hugging Face integration](https://huggingface.co/collections/worstchan/eat-6815b4f1034f5214f9063948)** ‚Äî if you're only performing **feature extraction or inference**, you no longer need to install Fairseq!


### üü° For feature extraction or inference only (Hugging Face)
No Fairseq needed. Simply run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cwx-worst-one/EAT
cd EAT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üîµ For pre-training or fine-tuning (Fairseq-based)
You need to install Fairseq manually:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./
git clone https://github.com/cwx-worst-one/EAT
pip install -r EAT/requirements.txt
```


## Model Checkpoints
We provide several EAT model checkpoints for download:

### üîπ EAT-base (introduced in paper; for efficient pre-training)

### üîπ Updated & Recommended Versions (with Hugging Face support)
We now release enhanced versions include extended training or larger backbone designs. They are also available in **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/worstchan/eat-6815b4f1034f5214f9063948)** ‚Äî allowing direct use for feature extraction or inference via `AutoModel.from_pretrained`.

## Feature Extraction
We provide the script for extracting audio features from the last layer of EAT encoder. The features are stored in `.npy` format and the sample rate of the extracted features is ~50Hz. EAT could provide frame-level features and utterance-level features (denoted by the CLS token).  
To extract latent representations from audio clips, you could use our pre-trained [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19hfzLgHCkyqTOYmHt8dqVa9nm-weBq4f/view?usp=sharing), fine-tuned [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCYiQmoZv_Gh1FxnR-CCWpNAp6DIJzn6/view?usp=sharing) or your owns, then please run the script `feature_extract.sh` by:
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/feature_extract.sh 
``` 

## Data Preparation
The main dataset in our experiment is [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/). Regrettably, we are unable to release the data due to copyright restrictions. Data manifest is available at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LH2C0q3d4zndoR3-oGkVdYYqDCIdxIsm/view?usp=drive_link). We follow the file format in [wav2vec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec) and [data2vec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/data2vec), where `.tsv` format file is for index while `.lbl` and `.csv` format files are specific for classification task.  You could modify the files for your own database. 

## Pre-Training 
Our codes are adapted from [Audio-MAE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AudioMAE) and [data2vec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/data2vec). We employ `pretraining_AS2M.yaml` as our default pre-training config. To pre-train the EAT model on Audioset, you could run the script `pretraining_AS2M.sh` by:
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/pretraining_AS2M.sh 
``` 
If you need to pre-train the EAT model on other datasets where audio lengths are not fixed at 10 seconds, you can refer to the instructions in
`feature_extract/readme.md`

## Fine-Tuning
We employ `finetuning.yaml` as our default fine-tuning config. To fine-tune the EAT model in different downstream tasks, you could run the script `finetuning_{task}.sh`, where `{task}` includes `AS20K`, `AS2M`, `ESC50` and `SPCv2`. For example, you can fine-tune EAT on `AS20K` by executing: 
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/finetuning_AS20K.sh
``` 

## Inference and Evaluation
For inference on single AudioSet audio clip with fine-tuned models, you could use our EAT checkpoints fine-tuning on [AS-2M](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F07zN8N54rXU-szvKUlYaCFMCepc4wHR/view?usp=sharing) (recommended) or [AS-20K](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRX_Mgj4sHxV2F6AVfoqXObfgzFMnHRA/view?usp=sharing)
and run the script `inference.sh` by: 
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/inference.sh 
``` 
An example output is as follows:
```
# top_k_prediction = 12

**************************************************
```
  
For comprehensive evaluation on the entire AudioSet eval dataset with fine-tuned EAT models, you could run the evaluation script `eval.sh` by:
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/eval.sh 
```
This script will give you the evaluation value of mAP on AudioSet test dataset. 
Per-class AP can be found under the path `./EAT/ap_log.txt`. You could also refer to our results of finetuned EAT models on evaluation set of Audioset under the path `./EAT/results`.

## Performance
Pre-training on AS-2M, EAT gains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several audio and speech classification datasets including AS-20K, AS-2M, ESC-50 and SPC-2.    
![Alt text](./src/EAT_performance.png)

<!-- omit in toc -->
## Efficiency
EAT achieves a total pre-training time reduction of ~15x compared to BEATs and ~10x relative to Audio-MAE. It costs only 10 epochs during EAT's pre-training on AS-2M.

## Experiment Logs
We report the experiment logs using [wandb](https://wandb.ai). We have published a  short WandB report detailing the training process and performance metrics of the EAT model. You could visit it [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/wxc12/obqrpq36).

## TODO 
- [x] release the final EAT large
- [x] update codes and checkpoints for friendly usage
- [ ] release the docker image

## Acknowledgement
Our codebase is based on the awesome [Audio-MAE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AudioMAE) and [data2vec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/data2vec) repo.
