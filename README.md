## Introduction 
EAT is an audio SSL model with high effectiveness and efficiency during self-supervised pre-training. You can find details in the paper [EAT: Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Efficient Audio Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03497). 


## Requirements and Installation
The minimum environment requirements are `Python >= 3.8` and `PyTorch >= 1.13`. We now support **[Hugging Face integration](https://huggingface.co/collections/worstchan/eat-6815b4f1034f5214f9063948)** ‚Äî if you're only performing **feature extraction or inference**, you no longer need to install Fairseq!


### üü° For feature extraction or inference only (Hugging Face)
No Fairseq needed. Simply run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cwx-worst-one/EAT
cd EAT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üîµ For pre-training or fine-tuning (Fairseq-based)
You need to install Fairseq manually:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./
git clone https://github.com/cwx-worst-one/EAT
pip install -r EAT/requirements.txt
```


## Model Checkpoints
We provide several checkpoints for download, including both the original paper version and enhanced variants.


### üîπ EAT-base (introduced in paper; for efficient pre-training)

- [Pre-trained (10 epochs)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10pklbY_fKraQUIBizSg1kv4lJXNWxpxl/view?usp=sharing)
- [Fine-tuned on AS-2M](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F07zN8N54rXU-szvKUlYaCFMCepc4wHR/view?usp=sharing)
- [Fine-tuned on AS-20K](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRX_Mgj4sHxV2F6AVfoqXObfgzFMnHRA/view?usp=sharing)


### üîπ Updated & Recommended Versions
These enhanced versions feature extended pre-training or larger backbones. 
- Checkpoints via **Google Drive** are compatible with Fairseq for further pre-training or fine-tuning.  
- **Hugging Face versions** support direct usage via `AutoModel.from_pretrained` for feature extraction or inference.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to our limited AudioSet subset compared to other models, we **recommend** pre-training EAT on your own data for better performance.


### üìà Performance Summary 
| Model      | Backbone | Params | Pre-train Epochs | AS-20K mAP (%) | AS-2M mAP (%) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|EAT-base|ViT-B|88M|10|40.3 | 48.6|
|EAT-base|ViT-B|88M|30|41.3 | 48.9|
|EAT-large|ViT-L|309M|20|**42.0** | **49.5**|


## Feature Extraction
We provide a simple script to extract audio features from the last layer of the EAT encoder. You can run feature extraction using either a **Fairseq checkpoint** or a **Hugging Face model**.  

To get started, simply run:
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/feature_extract.sh 
``` 

For more detailed instructions, see the [feature extraction guide](./feature_extract/readme.md).


## Data Preparation
The main dataset in our experiment is [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/). Regrettably, we are unable to distribute the original audio files due to copyright restrictions. 

However, you can access our **data manifest** [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LH2C0q3d4zndoR3-oGkVdYYqDCIdxIsm/view?usp=drive_link), which provides metadata and paths necessary for processing. We follow the file format in [wav2vec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec) and [data2vec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/data2vec), where `.tsv` format file is for index while `.lbl` and `.csv` format files are specific for classification task.  You are free to modify the files to suit your own datasets or experimental needs.


## Pre-Training 
Our codes are adapted from [Audio-MAE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AudioMAE) and [data2vec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/data2vec). The default configuration file for pre-training is `pretraining_AS2M.yaml`. To pre-train the EAT model on AudioSet, simply run the following script:
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/pretraining_AS2M.sh 
``` 
If you wish to pre-train the model on a different dataset where audio clips are **not fixed to 10 seconds**, please refer to the [feature extraction guide](./feature_extract/readme.md) for detailed instructions on how to adjust the target length accordingly.


## Fine-Tuning
We use `finetuning.yaml` as the default configuration file for fine-tuning. To fine-tune the EAT model in different downstream tasks, you could run the script `finetuning_{task}.sh`, where `{task}` refers to one of the supported datasets, including `AS20K`, `AS2M`, `ESC50`, and `SPCv2`. For example, you can fine-tune EAT on `AS20K` by executing: 
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/finetuning_AS20K.sh
``` 


## Inference and Evaluation
We support both local inference and loading models via Hugging Face. To run inference on a single AudioSet audio clip using fine-tuned EAT models, you may use our checkpoint fine-tuned on [AS-2M](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F07zN8N54rXU-szvKUlYaCFMCepc4wHR/view?usp=sharing) (recommended) or [AS-20K](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRX_Mgj4sHxV2F6AVfoqXObfgzFMnHRA/view?usp=sharing). Alternatively, you can load the models directly from Hugging Face.

To start inference, run: 
```bash
bash EAT/scripts/inference.sh 
``` 
An example output is as follows:
```
# top_k_prediction = 12

**************************************************
```

To evaluate on the full AudioSet evaluation set, use:

```bash
bash EAT/scripts/eval.sh 
```

This will report the evaluation value of mAP on the test set. Per-class AP scores are saved to `./EAT/ap_log.txt`. You could also refer to our results of finetuned EAT models on evaluation set of Audioset in `./EAT/results`.

## Performance
Pre-training on AS-2M, EAT gains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several audio and speech classification datasets including AS-20K, AS-2M, ESC-50 and SPC-2.    
![Alt text](./src/EAT_performance.png)


<!-- omit in toc -->
## Efficiency
EAT achieves a total pre-training time reduction of ~15x compared to BEATs and ~10x relative to Audio-MAE. The full pre-training on AS-2M requires only 10 epochs.
